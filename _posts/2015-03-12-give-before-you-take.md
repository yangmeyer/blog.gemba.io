When I first integrated the fabulously simple [Paddle SDK](http://paddle.com) into Gemba for licensing and payments, I went with the simplest of options: a 30-day trial. This was dumb, and here is why.

## Why offer a trial?

A free trial **lets prospective users evaluate whether an app fits their needs** or solves their problem.

With Gemba, as long as you never got as far as connecting a Git repository and delivering an asset, then really you haven’t seen how it can help you in your work. So why on earth should Gemba force the decision on you just because 30 days are up?

## Create value first

With the latest beta release, I have switched to a delivery-based trial. As a new user, you get to **deliver 20 assets for free** (to as many repositories and for as long as you want) before Gemba asks you to buy a license.

This is so much better because it asks for your money only **after it has proven its worth to you**. The number of assets delivered is a decent proxy for the value that Gemba creates for you.

The delivery-based trial fundamentally aligns our interests: If the app is not for you, I don’t want your money. Only if my app provides **real value to you**, you buy it and I **earn** money.

Earlier this year, I experienced what you might call a crisis of confidence. All of the metrics were disturbingly low, with no signs of any significant upward trend. I started doubting whether Gemba’s value proposition was a viable one. I was unmotivated and simply did not know what I should do to make it work.
 
Here is how I got through this phase of disillusionment, and why I’m not done with Gemba in spite of everything.

## Loose mind & wandering thoughts

In the summer, I went for a week-long hike in Sweden with my girlfriend. We walked through light forests covered with blueberries, along deep blue lakes and with occasional panoramas of the wide open Baltic sea. One reason I love long-distance hikes is that, by the second or third day of walking, my mind starts to feel deeply relaxed.

There’s **something meditative** to just walking for hours on end, mindlessly following a marked trail, without needing to decide anything, with hours (or days) without talking; effectively with nothing to do but to feel the wind, pick wild strawberries and smell the wet earth – and to continue walking.

Without directing it at all, my mind kept coming back to Gemba. I contemplated its beginnings, successes, challenges, and shortcomings. I contemplated what I myself actually wanted. And kept on walking.

And slowly, gradually, I understood more clearly what I was doing, and why.

## Why care?

I am fundamentally doing all “this” – creating Gemba, blogging, [speaking at conferences]({% post_url 2015-09-25-ways-to-tighten-designer-developer-collaboration %}) –, because **I believe in my vision of better designer–developer collaboration**. I believe that better cross-functional collaboration leads to better products, and that better tools can improve how we work together.

Gemba, as it currently stands, may not be the solution to the problem. But that’s OK. This hasn’t changed that I still care deeply about improving colloboration, and I still believe that, through my experiences as both a designer and a developer, I _can_ contribute to making things better.

Therefore, there’s just no good reason for me _not_ to continue poking at the problem, even if that means attacking it from a different angle. I might not have the solution, but I’m **not through with the problem**. So I’m going to keep on going.

## So what’s next?

Gemba will likely **change significantly** in shape and functionality. It will still aim to improve designer–developer collaboration over assets, but with a different focus. (If you can spare 4 minutes, help shape Gemba’s future by [taking this survey](https://gemba.typeform.com/to/EFpbJu)!)

I am writing up some of the **lessons I learned** along the way and will publish them on this blog over the next few months.

I have some ideas for the near future, and I’ve been working on a little fun side-project that you’ll hear more about soon. Subscribe to the mailing list below to stay tuned :)

Till then, take care—
